OBJ Viewer 3D (old -- angularjs)

# NOTE: this is mainly meant to be a private repo, look at it at your own risk.

* AngularJS-based OBJ viewer, using threeJS. Upload 3D obj files and view them, rotate and zoom. (This was a *really old* project, my how my coding habits and styles have changed over the years!)

* This project is not guaranteed to be actively maintained. (Most likely will upgrade into something far better!)

* Still want to play with it? 
> git clone

> npm start

--> Navigate to localhost:8000 and upload the OBJ files in the `examples/` folder. Have fun!
